  "Description": "A 30-metre land surface temperature (LST) map of London derived from SDGSAT-1 thermal imagery provides highly detailed thermal patterns across the city, resolving differences between streets, rooftops, parks, and industrial sites at neighbourhood scale. SDGSAT-1\u2019s Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS) offers three thermal bands at ~30 m resolution, enabling LST products with much finer spatial detail than many previous spaceborne thermal sensors.  \n\n With that resolution, the map can reveal fine-scale urban hotspots \u2014 warm road corridors, dense built-up blocks, and heat-emitting industrial areas \u2014 alongside cooler patches where parks, tree canopies, and water bodies reduce surface temperatures. Studies and algorithm tests for SDGSAT-1 show that 30 m TIR data improve detection of industrial heat sources and support robust LST retrievals when appropriate atmospheric correction and emissivity methods are applied.",
